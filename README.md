# 1 on 1 Chatting Server side
### Curious how Swift works on server sideðŸ¤”, also, I would like to learn about webSocket. So I started this project, using [Vapor](https://docs.vapor.codes/). **For demo purposes only.**

Before running this project, you have to set the [working directory](https://docs.vapor.codes/getting-started/xcode/?h=working#custom-working-directory) for Xcode, and a `.env` file as below:

```
HOSTNAME=[YOUR HOSTNAME]
JWT_SECRET_KEY=[YOUR SECRET KEY]

APNS_KEY_P8_FILE_PATH=[APNS KEY FILE PATH] // e.g.: keys/AuthKey_XXXXX.p8
APNS_KEY_ID=[APNS KEY ID]
APNS_TEAM_ID=[YOUR TEAM ID]
APNS_APP_BUNDLE_ID=[APP BUNDLE ID]
APNS_ENVIRONMENT=[APNS ENVIRONMENT] // development or production
```
